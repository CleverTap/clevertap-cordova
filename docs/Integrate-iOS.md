## Setup encryption for PII data
PII data is stored across the SDK and could be sensitive information. 
From Cordova SDK `v2.7.1`. onwards, you can enable encryption for PII data wiz. **Email, Identity, Name and Phone**.  
  
Currently 2 levels of encryption are supported i.e None(0) and Medium(1). Encryption level is None by default.  

**None** - All stored data is in plaintext    
**Medium** - PII data is encrypted completely. 
   
The only way to set encryption level is from the info.plist. Add the `CleverTapEncryptionLevel` String key to `info.plist` file where value 1 means Medium and 0 means None. Encryption Level will be None if any other value is provided.

## Integrate Javascript with the Plugin

- Refer to our [Usage Documentation](/docs/Usage.md) for implementation.
